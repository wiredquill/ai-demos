Demo 4: Building Trustworthy AI on a Secure Foundation
Goal: Demonstrate how SUSE NeuVector helps build secure AI applications by scanning and profiling the workload during the development phase.

Key Steps:

Show the NeuVector UI and navigate to the "Assets" -> "Registries" section.

Demonstrate a vulnerability scan of a container image used in the AI workload. Highlight any discovered CVEs.

Switch to the "Groups" view and select the AI application group.

Put the group in Discover Mode.

Interact with the AI application (e.g., run an inference query).

Show the "Behavioral Profile" in NeuVector, which automatically learns the application's normal process and file access activity.

What to Look For:

The "shift-left" security approach, where vulnerabilities are caught early.

NeuVector's ability to automatically create a baseline of normal behavior for the AI application, forming the foundation for a zero-trust policy.
