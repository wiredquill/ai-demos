# SUSE AI HR Assistant Demo

## Overview

Demonstrate the power of **SUSE AI** with comprehensive observability for large language model applications. This HR Assistant demo showcases how OpenLit seamlessly integrates with SUSE Observability to provide complete visibility across your entire LLM-powered application stack.

## What This Demo Shows

### 🔍 **Complete LLM Observability**
When working with large language model applications, observability becomes critical. You need to know not just what your app is doing, but how model calls, chains, and agents behave in production. This demo shows:

- **Automatic Instrumentation**: OpenLit builds directly on top of OpenTelemetry, automatically instrumenting popular LLM SDKs like OpenAI, Ollama, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI
- **Zero-Code Telemetry**: Every prompt, response, embedding, and tool call is captured as a trace without sprinkling observability code throughout your business logic
- **Seamless Integration**: Traces and metrics flow directly into SUSE Observability for full-stack visibility

### 🏢 **Realistic HR Use Case**
The demo simulates a production HR application with three interconnected components:
- **HR Assistant**: Direct conversational interface for employee inquiries
- **HR Policy Database**: RAG-based system for policy document queries
- **Employee Handbook**: Document search and retrieval system

### 📊 **GPU Performance Monitoring**
Track critical GPU metrics that matter for ROI and efficiency:
- **GPU Utilization (%)**: Monitor how busy GPUs are to ensure ROI and identify inefficiencies
- **Memory Usage (VRAM)**: Prevent slowdowns and failures from maxed-out VRAM
- **Temperature & Power**: Ensure hardware longevity and manage energy costs for green computing
- **Process-level Metrics**: Track which jobs consume GPU resources for fairness and security

## Demo Flow

### 1. **Application Health & Topology View**
- View all AI workloads in your environment through SUSE Observability's topology view
- Zoom in to see the HR app ecosystem and how components communicate
- Observe real-time interactions between HR Assistant, Policy Database, and Employee Handbook

### 2. **Deep Dive into LLM Operations**
- Click on Ollama to see token usage patterns and cost metrics
- Drop timeline pins to correlate token consumption with system behavior
- View component details including deployment information and node assignments

### 3. **Token Cost Analysis**
- Track total token usage across all HR applications
- Monitor cost per model and per request
- View cost trends and optimization opportunities

### 4. **Infrastructure Correlation**
- Follow pins from token usage to actual GPU power consumption
- See how LLM requests translate to infrastructure utilization
- Correlate application behavior with underlying hardware metrics

### 5. **Application Tracing**
- Drill down into individual traces to see exactly what's happening in your application
- View request latency, token counts, and response times
- Compare current performance against historical norms
